    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    My name is <mark class="red-bold">Evgenii Shiliaev</mark>. I'm a student at
    <mark class="red-bold"> College of Polytechnics Jihlava</mark>. I am
    involved in IT both academically and professionally. In my free time I play

    <mark class="red-bold">Dundgeons & Dragons</mark> games.

    <ul>
      <li>Russian,</li>
      <li>Czech,</li>
      <li>English;</li>

      Brno, the city I have called home for four years now, has enchanted me
      with its ideal climate and endless possibilities. I come from a small
      northern city and I've also experienced the hustle and bustle of a big
      metropolis, but Brno is the perfect middle ground. The city offers me
      everything I could ever need, and yet I discover something new every day.
      Although I have lived here for some time, Brno still surprises and
      delights me. I appreciate the balance and convenience it brings me, and I
      have no intention of leaving anytime soon. For more information about
      Brno, you can here. More information about Brno can be found
      <a href="https://www.brno.cz/">here</a>
