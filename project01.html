      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      My name is Evgenii Shiliaev. I'm a student at the Higher School of
      Economics and both at school and at work I work in IT. In my free time I
      play piano and ukulele. Sometimes I engage my imagination in Dundgeons &
      Dragons games. I speak Russian, Czech and English, I understand Slovak and
      partly also Ukrainian. My big dream is to create my own video game.

      <h2>Brno</h2>
      Brno, the city I have called home for four years now, has enchanted me
      with its ideal climate and endless possibilities. I come from a small
      northern city and I've also experienced the hustle and bustle of a big
      metropolis, but Brno is the perfect middle ground. The city offers me
      everything I could ever need, and yet I discover something new every day.
      Although I have lived here for some time, Brno still surprises and
      delights me. I appreciate the balance and convenience it brings me, and I
      have no intention of leaving anytime soon. For more information about
      Brno, you can here. https://www.brno.cz/
